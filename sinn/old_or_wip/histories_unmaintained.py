class SpiketrainCOO(ConvolveMixin, PopulationHistory):
    """
    This is the same as histories.Spiketrain, except that data are stored an
    a COO array.

    A class to store spiketrains, grouped into populations.

    These are stored in a sparse array where spikes are indicated by ones.
    Instead of the `shape` parameter, we use `pop_slices` to indicate the
    neurons associated to each population, from which `shape` is automatically
    deduced. Only 1d timeslices are currently supported (i.e. all populations
    are arranged along one axis).

    Internally spikes are stored in a coo array, for fast addition of new
    spikes. It is cast to csr for slicing. See the :py:mod:`scipy.sparse`
    documentation for a discussion of different sparse array types.

    There are still a few unsolved challenges preventing using this class in a
    Theano graph at the moment. Notably, Theano only supports csc and csr.
    Moreover, Theano docs warn against using sparse arrays within `scan()`, as
    would almost certainly be required. Still, since :py:class:`Spiketrain`
    converts its data to CSR/CSC for mathematical operations, it should suffice
    to add a basic COO class to the backend with only conversion methods, in
    order to get a functioning :py:class:`Spiketrain` class.

    For more serious inference work using sparse arrays, one may want consider
    switching the backend to either PyTorch or TensorFlow, both of which use the
    COO format instead of CSR/CSC for their sparse matrices.

    .. Note::
       Although this class was designed to simulate and store spike trains,
       since the data type and update functions are arbitrary, it can just as
       well be used for any kind of sparse data. Depending on the needs of the
       application, the convolution functions may need to be redefined.

    pop_sizes: Tuple[int]
        Tuple of population sizes. Since the shape is calculated as

        If not specified, the data is initialized to zero.
        Note that the initialized data is set for the first n time indices,
        so if padding is present, those will be before t0. Consequently, the
        typical use is to use n equal to the padding length (i.e. self.t0idx).
        If `init_data` does not provide a dtype, it must be given as argument.
    dtype: numpy dtype, Optional (default: 'int8')
        Type to use for storing the data. If both `init_data` and `dtype`
        are provided, data will be cast to `dtype`. If neither is provided,
        the 'int8' type is used, to be compatible with Theano bools.

        # To understand why the convolution is taken this way, consider
        # 1) That sparse arrays are matrices, so * is actually matrix multiplication
        #    (which is why we use the `multiply` method)
        # 2) `multiply` only returns a sparse array if the argument is also 2D
        #    (But sometimes still returns a dense array ?)
        # 3) That sparse arrays are always 2D, so A[0,0] is a 2D, 1x1 matrix
        #    Moreover, one can't add a 3rd dimension to a sparse array to
        #    broadcast along that dimension
        # 4) The .A attribute of a matrix returns the underlying array
        # 5) That we do not need to multiply by the step size (dt): This is a discretized
        #    train of Dirac delta peaks, so to get the effective height of the spike
        #    when spread over a bin we should first divide by dt. To take the convolution
        #    we should then also multiply by the dt, cancelling the two.
        # Addendum) Points 1-4 are specific to scipy.sparse (and by corollary
        #    theano.sparse). If we used pydata's sparse (which is COO), along
        #    with the sparse formats in TensorFlow or PyTorch (also COO), we
