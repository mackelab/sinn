# Old and work-in-progress (WIP)

The files in this directory are implementations that, for any of a variety of reasons, were replaced by different implementations or removed altogether. Because they've already gone through quite a bit of testing, we keep them here while this project is still in a alpha stage of development: in case we want to refer to them, or even promote them back into the code base in the future.

## Status of modules

  - *axisdata.py*: Planned for porting to v0.2
  - *history_functions.py*: Waiting to see if still required in v0.2
  - *histories_unmaintained.py*: No immediate work planned. Ultimate status undecided.
  - *models_alternative*: Will be removed if the current *models* implementation proves robust.
