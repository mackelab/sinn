# Data manipulation

def smooth(series, amount=None, method='mean', **kwargs):
    """Smooth the `series` and return as another Series instance.
    Data is smoothed by averaging over a certain number of data points
    (determined by `amount`) at each time point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series: History.Series instance
        The data we want to smooth.
    amount: int | float
        A numerical parameter controlling the degree of smoothing.
        Its interpretation depends on the chosen method.
    method: string
        One of:
          + 'mean': A running average along the data. The number
                    of bins is determined by `amount`.
          + 'gaussian': Not implemented
          + 'convolve': Not implemented
        Default is 'mean'.

    Return
    ------
    Series instance
        Note that in general the time range will be shorter than
        the original data, due to the averaging.
