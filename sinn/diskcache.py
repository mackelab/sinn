"""
Functions for maintaining an on-disk cache of objects.
The use-case here is a relatively long-running program, which may
create many objects that are long to compute. So we want to cache
the computations and save the objects for the program's whole lifetime, but
there are many of them so we don't want to leave them in memory.

Importantly, the cache is explicitly not maintained between program
executions. A blank cache file is created whenever this module is first imported.

Objects that are cached to disk must implement a __hash__ method that does not depend on the particular instance. Objects are retrieved with the result of their __hash__, so if it is instance dependent, that cache entry will never be retrieved.
Typically __hash__ should depend on the set of parameters that define the object.
