* TODO Deprecate `use_theano` attribute and parameter in History
  _data should always be a shared variable
* TODO Parameter replace function for models
  Would take graph, parameter, new name, "to" and "from" conversion functions (e.g. 10** and log)
  Would then take care of cloning the graph, replacing with the "to" converted new parameter
  and setting the value of the shared parameter with the "from" conversion
* TODO Uniform kernel
* TODO Allow combinations of kernels (e.g. uniform + exp)
* TODO Allow setting portions of a history
* TODO Memory-less Series (i.e. variable)
  - Include 'get_value' method for easy sequential updating
  - Only update once per t
  - Only update to next t
  - Cannot update to past t
* TODO Lag method for histories
  Return the value of a history at some lag
  - Allows using index for time and float for lag, or vice-versa
  - Allows using a different lag for each component
  - Don't require evaluation beyond the latest lag
  - Idea: implement a HistoryView, which allows indexing of histories
    at lagged times. So call could be `A.lag(3)[t]`
* TODO Attach list of inputs to history
* TODO Allow input dependencies to specify a lag
  Should be possible to give to m the dependency m_lag1, while
  keeping m 'batch computable'.
* TODO Don't allow negative integer indices for histories
* TODO [Spiketrain] Attach connectivity matrix to kernel, not spiketrain
** Will need to figure out how to expand the connectivity matrix
   Possibly something like the 'discretize' pattern, where it is attached to the kernel ?
* TODO [History] Allow to specify no. of bins in __init__, instead of t0 & tn
* TODO [History] Detect when name is reused, and add suffix.
* FIXME [History] Compound operations don't work. E.g. : (A-a) * (B-b), with A,B histories.
* FIXME [Analyze.plot] History names/labels with multiple underscores break if we try to plot legend
* TODO Multiple 'monitor' levels for logging
