* Priority 1
** TODO Make history dependency resolution local
   Don't search sinn.inputs for the list of inputs, but keep the list of inputs
in the history itself.
*** TODO Make HistoryBase derive from a Node class (or replace by?)
   Then make the elements of _globals.inputs Node instances
*** TODO Change sinn.inputs to sinn.histories
** TODO Parameters -> Sumatra Parameters

* Priority 2
** BUG [History] Compound operations don't work. E.g. : (A-a) * (B-b), with A,B histories.
** TODO Memory-less Series (i.e. variable)
   - Include 'get_value' method for easy sequential updating
   - Only update once per t
   - Only update to next t
   - Cannot update to past t
** TODO Allow setting portions of a history
** TODO Lag method for histories
   Return the value of a history at some lag
   - Allows using index for time and float for lag, or vice-versa
   - Allows using a different lag for each component
   - Don't require evaluation beyond the latest lag
   - Idea: implement a HistoryView, which allows indexing of histories
     at lagged times. So call could be `A.lag(3)[t]`
** TODO [History] Detect when name is reused, and add suffix.
** TODO [gradient-descent] Index with variable names rather than Theano variable.
   At the moment we first need to load a model first just to have dictionary keys
   to which to assign traces, etc. This means we need to instantiate a model just to
   read the results of a fit.
   Search for 'name indexing' in gradient_descent.py
** TODO [gradient descent] Don't save parameter evolutions for clamped parameters

* Priority 3

** TODO Parameter replace function for models
   Would take graph, parameter, new name, "to" and "from" conversion functions (e.g. 10** and log)
   Would then take care of cloning the graph, replacing with the "to" converted new parameter
   and setting the value of the shared parameter with the "from" conversion
** TODO Deprecate `use_theano` attribute and parameter in History
   _data should always be a shared variable
** TODO Allow combinations of kernels (e.g. uniform + exp)
** TODO Attach list of inputs to history
** TODO Allow resizing a History (esp. reducing)
** TODO Allow input dependencies to specify a lag
   Should be possible to give to m the dependency m_lag1, while
   keeping m 'batch computable'.
** TODO Uniform kernel
** TODO [Spiketrain] Attach connectivity matrix to kernel, not spiketrain
*** Will need to figure out how to expand the connectivity matrix
    Possibly something like the 'discretize' pattern, where it is attached to the kernel ?
** TODO [History] Allow to specify no. of bins in __init__, instead of t0 & tn
** TODO Multiple 'monitor' levels for logging
** TODO [History] Allow argument to 'pad' to be another history
   Padding would then be adjusted to include at least as much padding

** TODO Add a destructor to models
   So that when we delete them, they also remove histories from sinn.histories
   Ideally only if those histories don't appear anywhere else. Or at least a warning.
org-todo-keywords
** TODO Allow History functions to deal with pure Python _data objects
   (Not just shared variables)

** TODO Catch when caught in a lookup loop (e.g. u[t] requires u[t] requires...)
   Raise an easier to understand error than "max recursion depth"

** DONE Check that on disk caching is successfully loading
** DONE Don't allow negative integer indices for histories

* Priority 4
