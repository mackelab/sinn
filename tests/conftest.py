    We have the problem that with testing, Theano seems to corrupt its own cache.
    I imagine that due to some race condition, multiple calls to `compile` end
    up using the same file name, which then leads to irreproducible errors.
    Since these don't occur when running any one test individually (with a
    clean cache), I think we can assume this is due to the testing environment.
    In any case it's not something we are equiped to fix.

    SOLUTION: Assign a different compilation directory for each test.

    # When the test is finished, monkeypatch undoes this modification, thus
    # destroying `tmpdir`, and the associated directory is deleted
